<h3 style="color: blue;">how to treat cuts</h3>

<p>The first step in cleaning cuts is to wash your hands. After that, if the cut is bleeding, apply light pressure to stop the bleeding. Wash the cut in warm water and apply soap around the cut. If debris is present in the wound, use tweezers to gently remove it. Put a thin layer of antibiotic over the wound. Cover the cut with a bandage or gauze.

<h3 style="color: crimson;">how to treat burns</h3>

<p>First-degree burns often result from common household accidents. It is comparable to a sunburn and characterized by minor redness and swelling in the burn area. To treat a first-degree burn, first run the affected area under cool water for up to 20 minutes. Do not use ice water or ice. This can disrupt the healing process. Use aloe vera or petroleum jelly (such as Vaseline) to moisturize the burn. Use a nonstick band-aid to cover the burn to protect it. Painkillers, such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen (Tylenol), may be necessary.

Second-degree burns are more severe and can lead to blistering of the skin. You are at risk of tetanus if you get a second-degree burn.  Any injury beyond a first-degree burn should be evaluated by a healthcare professional. To treat a second-degree burn, pour cool, clean water over the affected area. Alternatively, you can use a cool towel. If the affected person was wearing clothes that covered the burned area at the time of the incident, do not remove the fabric around the area. There is a very real chance that it is stuck to the wound. Do not use any ointment. Do not pop any blisters. If one does pop naturally, cover it with a sterile dressing designed to treat burns.

Third-degree burns are burns that can go down to the bone. You should go to the emergency room or a doctor's office as soon as possible.

<h3 style="color: yellowgreen;">how to identify broken bones </h3>

<p>Broken bones can occur following an impact to the body. You may have broken a bone if you experience swelling, bruising, or bleeding in the affected area. You may not be able to move the area or bear weight on it. There may be an obvious piece of bone protruding from the skin. It’s best to visit the doctor as soon as possible and try to avoid bearing weight or moving the affected area more than necessary. There are additional sources on splinting in the sources page.

<h3 style="color: purple">how to identify and respond to seizures</h3>

<p> Small disclaimer: If someone is obviously having a seizure, be sure to check if they have left a note nearby or if they are wearing a medical alert bracelet. 
Seizures exhibit a range of symptoms, including unresponsiveness, shaking or other involuntary movements, confusion, and disorientation. Symptoms can manifest differently in each individual. Ensure the affected person is turned on their side and moved away from any potential environmental hazards. Do not put anything in the person’s mouth. Remove any eyeglasses to prevent injury. Make sure to time the length of the seizure. Call 911 if someone is having a seizure. Stay with them until they either confirm they are okay and have someone to look after them, or until an ambulance arrives. These steps are for seizures that include violent shaking or jerking movements. 

If someone is having a seizure that has physical symptoms, but rather mental symptoms (e.g., disorientation, inattention, confusion), then follow these instructions. Watch them to make sure they do not hurt themselves or others. If possible, identify the type of seizure. Speak calmly and quietly to them.
